 Kitchen fire in Sandbach Time of Incident: 12/04/2019 - 22:39 Location: The Hill, Sandbach Attendance: Three fire engines attended - two from Crewe and one from Sandbach - as did a special vehicle from Sandbach Shortly after 10.30pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a house at The Hill in Sandbach and that someone was inside the property. On arrival crews discovered that it was a kitchen fire that had caused a lot of smoke and everyone was accounted for. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus began to use a hose reel jet to fight the fire. A covering jet was also set up. The gas supply was isolated, a cordon was set up for safety and neighbouring properties were evacuated. First aid was administered to casualties suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation. They were handed over to the care of paramedics and some were taken to hospital as a precaution. Once the fire was out firefighters used a large fan to clear smoke from house and adjacent flats affected by the fire. The electricity supply to affected properties were isolated and firefighters used a thermal imaging camera to check for signs of the fire having spread beyond the house it started in. They also removed debris from the house and cut back the kitchen to clean wood. Firefighters did not have to fight fire in the flats. They were in attendance for around three hours. Police attended to manage traffic. A fire investigation has begun to establish the cause of the fire. Early indications are that the most likely cause is an electrical fault in the kitchen.
