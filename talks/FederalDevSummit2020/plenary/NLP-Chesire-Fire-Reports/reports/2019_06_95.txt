On arrival the crews discovered that the collision involved a heavy goods vehicle and a van and that no one was trapped inside either vehicles.  They also found that a large quantity of diesel had leaked from the HGV after its fuel tank had been destroyed in the collision.  Approximately 300 to 400 litres of diesel leaked from the vehicle and was going down three drains. The road was closed and firefighters used specialist clay mats and moved earth to limit the amount of diesel going down the drains. They also used a pop-up dam to prevent further leakage.  Specialist environmental protection resources attended from Powey Lane Fire Station. All possible environmental protection measures were undertaken by firefighters before they handed the incident over to Cheshire East Council's highways department, who were left in charge of removing the remaining spillage from the roadway and arranged for a gully sucker to attend.  Gully suckers can suck spillages out of drains. Firefighters were in attendance for around three hours. Police also attended.  No-one is believed to have been injured as a result of the incident.
