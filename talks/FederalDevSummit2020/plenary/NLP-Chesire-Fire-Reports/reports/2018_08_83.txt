 Electricity meter fire in a pub cellar in Crewe Time of Incident: 13/08/2018 - 13:16 Location: West Street, Crewe Attendance: Three fire engines attended - two from Crewe and one from Nantwich At around 1.15pm firefighters were called to a report of smoke coming from the cellar of the Wolverton Arms on West Street in Crewe. On arrival at the pub crews discovered a fire involving an electricity meter that had affected floorboards. Firefighters set up a cordon and used CO2 extinguishers to fight the fire. They also wore electrical gloves to remove the main fuse from the incoming electricity supply and then cut away burnt and affected materials. Firefighters then checked for hotspots using a thermal imaging camera. Although the fire was out at 2pm crews stayed at the scene until the electricity supply had been isolated by the electricity provider and the meter board had been removed. Once the board was removed firefighters checked behind it for hotspots using the thermal imaging camera. They were in attendance for around two hours and 15 minutes.
