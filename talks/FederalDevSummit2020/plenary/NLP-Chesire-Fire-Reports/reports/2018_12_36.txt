Firefighters put a safety cordon in place and, with a hose reel on standby, allowed the fire to burn until utility companies - gas, water and electricity - arrived. Police managed the traffic on the one-way street. When a gas company arrived firefighters set up two covering jets as the company looked for the source of the gas leak and tried to isolate it.
