Fatal house fire in Macclesfield Time of Incident: 01/02/2015 - 07:34 Location: Hulley Road, Macclesfield. Attendance: Fire engines from Macclesfield, Congleton and Poynton initially Just before 7.30 am the Service received reports of a house fire on Hulley Road in Macclesfield.  Fire engines from Macclesfield, Congleton and Poynton were sent to the scene and on arrival found a well developed fire involving the ground floor of a mid-terraced house with flames spreading up into the first floor of the property. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus put a covering jet in place.  Four further firefighters in breathing apparatus began using two hose reel jets to tackle the fire and neighbouring properties were evacuated in case the blaze spread. Crews also began using a specialist pressure fan to tackle the incident.  The police closed roads in the immediate vicinity while crews remained tackling the fire.   Firefighters were able to prevent the blaze from spreading to adjacent properties but remained at the scene for several hours damping down.  Sadly a body was found inside the house and a joint investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing with police.  Watch Manager at Macclesfield Fire Station, Andy Humberstone, said: “We arrived to find a fully developed fire. The front windows had been blown out, and the living room was ablaze. The first floor was on fire as well.  “We were told that an elderly lady lived there. Crews with breathing apparatus went in. It was very, very hot. There was a lot of damage but I would say I am 80 per cent sure it started in the living room. The cause is still under investigation.”
