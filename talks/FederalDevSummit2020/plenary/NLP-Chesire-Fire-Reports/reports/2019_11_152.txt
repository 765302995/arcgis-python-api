 Fire in a stable, Willaston Time of Incident: 03/11/2019 - 04:10 Location: Newcastle Road, Willaston Attendance: Two fire engines from Nantwich and Crewe Fire in a stable, WillastonFirefighters were called after a fire broke out at a stable on Newcastle Road. They found one end of the stable well alight and used two hose reels and two breathing apparatus to tackle it. The crew inspected the other stables to check for fire spread and any animals that might have been present.  They soon brought the fire under control, which not only involved the stable itself but also a considerable amount of hay, measuring around 7m x 3m. Crews turned over the hay using stack drags to damp down, and ensured there was no chance of reignition by using a thermal imaging camera. They were doing this for just over two hours.  A 30-year-old man suffered minor burns to his legs and slight smoke inhalation during his attempts to deal with the fire when it first broke out, and was taken to hospital by paramedics.
