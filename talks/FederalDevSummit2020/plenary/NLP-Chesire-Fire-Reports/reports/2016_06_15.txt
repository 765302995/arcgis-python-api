Bungalow on fire in Poynton Time of Incident: 27/06/2016 - 08:07 Location: Burton Drive, Poynton Attendance: Fire engines from Cheshire (Poynton and Wilmslow) and Greater Manchester (Stockport, Cheadle and Offerton)attended Firefighters were called to a dormer bungalow on fire. On arrival they found one man outside the property and the property full of smoke. Crews from Cheshire and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Services used two hose reel jets and a high pressure lance, also known as a cold cut*, to extinguish the fire.  Smoke alarms, which had previously been fitted by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, alerted the householder to the fire and enabled him to get out of the property. Although he needed treatment from paramedics, the smoke alarms almost certainly saved his life.  *A cold cut is a high pressure piece of kit that introduces water into an area without the need to commit firefighters, the result being a rapid reduction in temperature in that area.
