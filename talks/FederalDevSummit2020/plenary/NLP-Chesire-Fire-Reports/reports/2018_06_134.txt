On arrival crews discovered that two sheds between two detached houses were on fire.  The fire spread to an integral garage on one side of the sheds and ruptured the external gas main feeding the house on the other side of the sheds.  All persons were accounted for.  A safety cordon was put in place around the affected area and police were in attendance.  Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to extinguish the shed fires. A covering jet was also used.  Three firefighters wearing breathing apparatus then used height safety equipment and a roof ladder to inspect fascia boards and soffits in one of the houses.  They then cut away fascia boards to access the affected house and used a hose reel jet to extinguish any hotspots found.  A hydraulic platform helped firefighters to inspect the roof of the property.  Firefighters also removed half the roof tiles from the affected garage and used a hose reel jet to extinguish flames.  Scottish Power attended and dug underground to isolate the gas and electricity supply to the properties.  A fire investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing.  Firefighters were in attendance for around six and-a-half hours.
