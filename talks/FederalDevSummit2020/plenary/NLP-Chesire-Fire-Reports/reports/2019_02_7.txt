 Fire at sheltered accommodation in Widnes Time of Incident: 26/02/2019 - 20:49 Location: Hargreaves Court, Widnes Attendance: Five fire engines attended - two from Penketh, one from Widnes, one from Warrington and one from Runcorn Firefighters were called to sheltered accommodation in Hargreaves Court, Widnes, as a smoke alarm was sounding in one of the flats. On arrival firefighters discovered a fire in the flat and smoke in a ground floor corridor. They rescued a man from the flat, who was taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. He was in a serious condition. A cordon was put in place and, due to heavy smoke logging, a full evacuation of the remaining ground floor flats was carried out. The fire was contained in the flat that the man was in. Six firefighters wearing breathing apparatus tackled the blaze using two hose reels jets. A covering jet was also set up. A large fan was used to clear the smoke. The smoke in the hallway was cleared via natural ventilation. Once the fire was under control the flat was damped down to make it safe. Firefighters then used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots to make sure that the flat and the rest of the sheltered accommodation were safe. Once the site was deemed to be safe residents were allowed back into their flats, shortly after midnight. Firefighters were in attendance for around three hours. An investigation has been carried out to establish how the fire started. It is believed to have been caused by smoking materials.
