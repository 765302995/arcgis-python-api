 Road traffic collision, M56 motorway Time of Incident: 19/04/2019 - 14:16 Location: Junction 12-14 WB, M56 motorway Attendance: Four fire engines attended (Ellesmere Port, Penketh, Runcorn, Widnes) Four fire crews attended following a collision on the westbound carriageway of the M56 motorway, between junctions 12 and 14. It involved a car and a van, which had become trapped in the outside lane, against the central reservation barrier. No-one was trapped, so crews used their fire engines to help fend traffic away from the scene into the other two lanes. No-one was seriously injured, with paramedics at the scene carrying out medical checks. Once those involved were safely out of their vehicles, crews moved the vehicles to the hard shoulder to make the scene safe and allow the lane to re-open. They were in attendance for around half an hour.
