 Wheelie bin fire, Winsford Time of Incident: 10/05/2019 - 22:32 Location: Peach Way, Winsford Attendance: One fire engine from Winsford Firefighters were deployed to a tackle with a wheelie bin fire near a house on Peach Way, Winsford. The fire was relatively small in the bin, but had impacted the electric box on the house. They used a single hose reel to put it out and utilised a thermal imaging camera to ensure the temperature was low enough to prevent reignition. It's not clear whether this could have been a deliberate act, so a fire investigator was requested to attend the following morning.
