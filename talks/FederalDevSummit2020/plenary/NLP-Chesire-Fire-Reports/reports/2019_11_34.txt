 Collision involving two HGVs on the M6 Time of Incident: 22/11/2019 - 07:27 Location: M6 southbound, between junctions 18 and 17 Attendance: Four fire engines attended, one from Holmes Chapel, one from Middlewich, one from Crewe and one from Sandbach Shortly before 7.30am firefighters were called to reports of a collision on the M6 southbound, between junctions 18 and 17.  On arrival crews discovered that the collision involved two heavy goods vehicles and that no-one was trapped inside either of them.  They fended off lanes one and two of the motorway as emergency services worked at the scene.  Firefighters also gave first aid to a man who had been involved in the collision and used absorbent pads to soak up engine fluids that had leaked from one of the HGVs.  In addition, they checked the engine's temperature with a thermal imaging camera to make sure that it was safe.  The injured man was handed over to the care of paramedics.  Firefighters were in attendance for around two hours.  Police and Highways England also attended.
