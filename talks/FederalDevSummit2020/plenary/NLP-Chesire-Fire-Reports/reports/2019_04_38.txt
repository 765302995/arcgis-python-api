 Fire at the back of a house in Warrington Time of Incident: 23/04/2019 - 19:51 Location: Boulting Avenue, Warrington Attendance: Two fire engines attended, one from Penketh and one from Birchwood At around 7.50pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire at the back of a house on Boulting Avenue in Warrington. On arrival crews discovered a large pile of rubbish, including tyres, well alight. The rubbish was up against the back of the house but the fire had not entered the property. The house was evacuated and everyone was accounted for. A firefighter administered oxygen to an occupier who had inhaled a small amount of smoke. They did not go to hospital. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire. Once the fire was out firefighters removed fascia boards and damped the area affected by the fire down to make it safe. They checked for hotspots using a thermal imaging camera. Firefighters were in attendance for less than an hour.
