Log burner fire on narrow boat in Church Minshull marina Time of Incident: 23/02/2015 - 15:43 Location: Church Minshull Marina, Church Minshull, Nantwich Attendance: Two fire engines from Winsford A log burner was the source of a fire in a narrow boat moored in Church Minshull marina.  Firefighters, two wearing breathing apparatus, isolated gas and electricity and used a hose reel jet to put out the fire, followed by a high pressure fan to ventilate smoke from the vessel.  The fire was caused when clothing hanging above the log burner to dry fell and caught fire.  Damage was fortunately confined to the clothing and a small area of the floor.  The alarm was raised by a smoke detector fitted on the narrow boat by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service.  An occupant on a neighbouring narrow boat heard the alarm and saw smoke issuing from the vessel.  They called the fire and rescue service out.
