On arrival crews discovered that no-one was unaccounted for and the fire involved a cooker in a kitchen. It had been left unattended as it was cooking food. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus entered the ground floor flat and the fire was extinguished with a hose reel jet. Once the fire was out the crews damped down the areas of the kitchen that had been affected by it. They also ventilated the flat and used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots. In addition, firefighters checked that the fire had not affected other flats in the block, again using a thermal imaging camera. Once they were satisfied that the flats were safe they handed the incident over to the landlord. Firefighters were in attendance for less than an hour-and-a-half.
