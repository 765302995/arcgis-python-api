Aerial appliance and supporting fire engine from Macclesfield and two fire engines from Staffordshire At 5.05 pm the Service was called to reports of a fire involving a hydraulic lifting platform inside industrial premises off Lawton Road, Alsager.  Two fire engines were sent to the scene initially and on arrival they found a well developed fire which had spread from the platform to the roof. Two further fire engines were sent to the scene as well as a hydraulic platform and crews wearing breathing apparatus began using a main jet to tackle the flames.  Firefighters also set up a ground monitor jet to fight the blaze and cool two cylinders which were involved in the fire.  The temperature of the cylinders was monitored by thermal image cameras and after the fire in the lift had been extinguished crews worked to stop the fire in the roof from spreading further.  One fire engine remained at the scene overnight. The crew reported no visible smoke, flames and hotspots overnight.  All fire engines have now left the incident. A fire investigation to determine the cause of the fire has been carried out. It was found to be accidental, caused by welding machinery.
