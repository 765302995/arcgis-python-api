 Gas leak at a mill in Macclesfield Time of Incident: 11/01/2019 - 12:46 Location: Goodall Street, Macclesfield Attendance:  Three fire engines attended - two from Macclesfield and one from Bollington At around 12.45pm firefighters were called to a report of a smell of gas in a ground floor workshop at Brook Street Mill on Goodall Street in Macclesfield.  The crews that attended set up covering jets as a precaution and the mill was evacuated. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus and carrying a hose reel jet located the source of the gas leak.  The gas was coming from a 6kg propane cylinder being used with a heater on the first floor of the mill. The cylinder was removed from the premises and firefighters helped to isolate the electricity supply to the affected area of the mill while the incident was being dealt with.  Firefighters also ventilated the mill with the aid of a large fan. They started with the lower floors and worked their way up. A gas engineer attended and carried out checks for the presence of gas under the supervision of firefighters.  All units were open to allow for natural ventilation and the gas main was deemed to be safe. Firefighters gained access to the roof space so that signs of gas could be checked there.  Once it was deemed that the mill was safe those evacuated were allowed back in. The leak is believed to have been caused by a loose connection.  Firefighters were in attendance for around two hours.
