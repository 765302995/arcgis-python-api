Garage on fire in Winsford Time of Incident: 02/08/2016 - 16:58 Location: Caernarvon Avenue, Winsford Attendance: Two fire engines from Winsford, one from Northwich and one from Crewe Firefighters tackled a fire involving a domestic garage on Caernarvon Avenue. Everyone from the adjoining houses is accounted for. Crews are using hose reel and main jets to tackle the blaze.  Firefighters, four wearing breathing apparatus, have searched the ground and first floor of the house with hose reel jets. The fire is was put out and smoke cleared using a high pressure fan. Gas and electricity engineers were asked to attend to isolate power supplies.  Adjacent properties were inspected by firefighters to make sure there has been no fire spread.  By 7.30pm two fire engines remained at the scene. Gas engineers detected a gas leak from the affected house. Four properties on the same side of the road, including the one involved in the fire, were evacuated and residents on the opposite side of Caernarvon Avenue were asked to remain in their homes with doors and windows shut.  A team of gas engineers began digging operations so they could find, isolate and seal the leak as firefighters stood by with a covering jet.    The gas supply was isolated both inside and outside the property and crews were able to check the house for hot spots, removing fascia boards from the front of the house and damping the fire affected areas down.  Firefighters finally left the scene just after 10pm.  Following an investigation the cause of the fire is believed to be accidental after a battery charger caught fire.
