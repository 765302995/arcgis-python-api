 Outbuilding fire in Warrington Time of Incident: 01/01/2019 - 19:47 Location: Park Lane, Warrington Attendance:  Four fire engines attended - one from Warrington, one from Penketh, one from Lymm and one from Stockton Heath - as did aerial platforms from Lymm and Chester and a relief crew from Widnes At around 7.45pm firefighters were called to reports of an outbuilding being on fire on Park Lane in Warrington. On arrival crews discovered a large fire involving a detached two-storey outbuilding.  Firefighters set up a cordon and established a water supply. They fought the fire from above using aerial platforms following a collapse in the structure and concerns for the safety of the crews.  Once the fire was out firefighters checked the outside of the building for hotspots using a thermal imaging camera. They left the scene once they were satisfied that it was safe.  Firefighters were in attendance for several hours. A building inspector from the local council has been requested to attend the site.  The fire is believed to have been started deliberately. Anyone with information about the incident should call Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 284329, give the details via https://cheshire.police.uk/contact/general-enquiries or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
