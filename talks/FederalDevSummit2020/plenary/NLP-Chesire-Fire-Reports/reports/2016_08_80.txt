Fire in wooded area in Neston Time of Incident: 17/08/2016 - 10:36 Location: Haddon Lane, Ness, Neston Attendance: One fire engine from Ellesmere Port A fire in a wooded area required firefighters to extinguish a smouldering fire. On arrival, crews found the lane leading to the fire was too narrow for the fire engine to travel through so they travelled on foot to the fire where they discovered it to be a five metre woodland fire, which was deep seated and burning away at the peat in the ground. The crews, assisted by a local farmer, were able to carry equipment to the fire using a tractor belonging to the farmer. They then tapped into a large pond with a hose and pumped water onto the fire to put it out.
