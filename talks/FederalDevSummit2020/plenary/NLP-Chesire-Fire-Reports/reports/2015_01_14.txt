The fire involved the roof and first floor of the property and crews used a main water jet and hose reels to fight this fire.   Crews had to withdraw from the house when the roof collapsed and were unable to carry out salvage operations until the stability of the chimneys and walls was checked by structural engineers.  Firefighters were at the scene for two days, unable to check whether the fire was fully extinguished because of the unstable structure.  However, they were able to regain entry and made sure that there were no remaining areas of fire.  Video Video - Firefighters tackling a house fire in Mouldsworth, Chester
