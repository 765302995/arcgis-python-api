When they arrived crews found that there was a significant fire involving the exterior of a silo at a large animal feeds mill. The silo contained animal fat and was adjacent to others containing kerosene and soya.  Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus quickly used hose reel and main water jets to contain the fire and prevent it from spreading to adjacent parts of the site. Water supplies were established from the River Dane and used to maintain cooling jets on the silo after the initial blaze was extinguished.  Crews stayed at the scene for some time afterwards and used thermal imaging cameras to monitor the temperature of the silo and to ensure the contents didn't flare up. Crews were at the scene for around six and a half hours.
