 House fire in Poynton Time of Incident: 24/05/2019 - 00:56 Location: Clumber Road, Poynton Attendance: Four fire engines attended - three from Greater Manchester Fire Service and one from Poynton Firefighters attended to a house fire on Clumber Road in Poynton.  The fire is believed to have been caused by an electrical cable, which caused a fence to be set on fire and spread to the roof space of the property.  Wearing two breathing apparatus, crews used one hose reel and a covering jet to put out the fire.  The fire had also spread to the roof space of another neighbouring property. Firefighters, still wearing two breathing apparatus, used a ladder to remove the tiles and isolate the utilities.  Once the fire had been extinguished crews used a thermal imaging camera to check the temperature, put salvage sheets on the affected properties and ensured the area was safe.  All people inside the property were accounted for.  They remained at scene for four hours and thirty minutes.
