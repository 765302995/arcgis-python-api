M6 northbound closed as crews tackle tanker fire at J16 Time of Incident: 06/04/2016 - 14:03 Location: M6 junction 16 northbound Attendance: Two fire engines from Crewe and one from Sandbach Firefighters were called to a tanker fire on the M6 northbound at J16 near Crewe. The crews, four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, used a hose reel jet and a foam line to tackle the blaze. Nobody was trapped in the vehicle.  The M6 was initially closed in both directions -and drivers were advised to avoid the area.  A small amount of diesel had leaked from one of the tanker's six compartments so crews  covered the area with a foam 'blanket' and they blocked the drains to prevent diesel entering them.  The fire is believed to have started due to a blown out tyre. The Environment Agency were informed   Mike Anderson, Group Manager for Prevention and Protection said: "The crews did a great job and were able to stop the fire spreading to the load of this vehicle. They also worked hard to contain the fluid and prevented it from entering drains and nearby land."
