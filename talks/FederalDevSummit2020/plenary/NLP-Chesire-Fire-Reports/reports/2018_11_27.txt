 Bedroom fire in Warrington Time of Incident: 25/11/2018 - 14:48 Location: Friends Lane, Warrington Attendance: Two fire engines attended â€“ one from Penketh and one Birchwood Shortly after 2.45pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire in a bedroom of a terraced house on Friends Lane in Penketh, Warrington.  On arrival crews discovered that all persons were accounted for and the fire was contained to the upstairs bedroom.  Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguish the fire with a hose reel jet.  They then used a large high pressure fan to clear smoke from the property and cut away and damped down materials affected by the fire to make sure they were safe.  Firefighters then removed the affected materials from the bedroom.  They also used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots.  The camera was used in the bedroom as well as in the loft spaces of the adjacent houses to make sure that the fire had not spread.  Firefighters were in attendance for around an hour and 45 minutes.  The fire is believed to have been started by a lit candle on a bedside cabinet.  For tips on using candles safely visit https://www.cheshirefire.gov.uk/public-safety/home-safety/candles-in-the-home.
