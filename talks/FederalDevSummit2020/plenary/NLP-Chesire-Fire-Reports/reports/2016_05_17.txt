House fire in Mobberley Time of Incident: 26/05/2016 - 21:32 Location: Knutsford Road, Mobberley Attendance: Nine fire engines, including an aerial appliance from Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service and four from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service Fire engines from Cheshire and Greater Manchester were called to a house fire on Knutsford Road in Knolls Green. The property was heavily involved in fire and crews divided the incident into three sectors to aid firefighting initially from the outside.   The crews used three main jets and an aerial appliance to tackle the blaze. Firefighters, two wearing breathing apparatus, then entered the loft space to prevent fire spread. The gas and electricity supplies were isolated and cordons road closures established by police. Once the blaze was under control the crews were able to set up salvage and damage control operations.  They used a seven metre ladder to access the roof gully and cut away and removed roof tiles to dampen that area down. A thermal imaging camera was then used in the roof space to make sure there was no fire spread. Firefighters remain at the scene to monitor the building and the road closures were lifted at around 5am.  An investigation into the cause of the fire will be undertaken by fire investigation officers.
