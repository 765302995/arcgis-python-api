Statement at 12:20pm Police are appealing for information following a suspected arson at Snugburys ice cream farm on Chester Road, near Nantwich.  On Wednesday 2 February, shortly before 5:45pm police were notified of a 38ft hay sculpture of Peter Rabbit on fire in the field adjacent to the farm.  Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service attended the scene and the fire was extinguished. An investigation has been launched and officers from Crewe Policing Unit are currently carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to trace those responsible.  Inspector Stuart York said: “Fortunately no-one was injured as a result of the fire but the consequences could have potentially been far worse had the fire not been put out so quickly, given its proximity to a major road.  “We are currently following up a number of lines of enquiry and I am keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen anyone acting suspiciously. If anyone believes that they have any information that could assist with our enquiries please come forward.”    Station Manager Matt Barlow said: “Our Nantwich firefighters battled to save this well known local landmark which was already well alight when they arrived.  We are working closely with our colleagues at Cheshire Police to establish the cause of the fire and would urge anyone with any information to get in touch.”  Anyone with any information is urged to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 742 of 2 February.  Information can also be left anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
