Tank leaking in Cranage Time of Incident: 14/10/2016 - 16:58 Location: Moss Lane, Cranage Attendance: Fire engines from Holmes Chapel and Winsford  Firefighters attended the scene of an incident involving a leaking tank in Cranage. A tractor was believed to have struck the tank, causing the leak. Crews set up cordons and allowed the tank, which contained propane gas, to vent before setting up a covering jet. Police were asked to attend to close the junction of the A50 and Byley Lane to the east of the incident and at the junction of the B5081 and Moss Lane to the west of the incident. Whilst crews dealt with the incident, residents within the cordon were advised to stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed.  Crews used a ground monitor to spray water on the ruptured tank whilst it was repaired.  Crews remained at the scene throughout the night containing the incident. The covering jet remained in place whilst firefighters measured the gas leak and eventually found the area to be free of gas.
