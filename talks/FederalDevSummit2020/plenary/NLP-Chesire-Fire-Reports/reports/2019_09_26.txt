 Fire involving recycling trailer on the back of a HGV in Frodsham Time of Incident: 25/09/2019 - 10:50 Location: Chester Road in Frodsham Attendance: Two fire engines attended, one from Chester and one from Powey Lane At 10.50am firefighters were called to reports of a fire involving the trailer on the back of a heavy goods vehicle on Chester Road in Frodsham. On arrival crews discovered approximately half a tonne of rubbish on fire in the recycling trailer unit. Firefighters opened the back of the trailer and began fighting the fire with a hose reel jet. They used a seven-metre ladder to help them to do this. The trailer was later driven by the HGV to a nearby landfill site for the rubbish to be removed from it so that the fire could be fully extinguished. A large water bowser and a hose reel jet enabled firefighters to do this. Firefighters also controlled traffic. They were in attendance for more than an hour.
