Thatched roof fire in Hale, Widnes Time of Incident: 15/10/2015 - 07:26 Location: Church End, Hale, Widnes. Attendance: Two fire engines from Widnes, one from Runcorn, two from Warrington, one from Ellesmere Port and one from Stockton Heath. Also in attendance are two hydraulic platforms from Chester and Stockton Heath, a crew from Knutsford and support from Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were called out to a report of a fire in the roof of a row of three thatched cottages. Upon arrival, the crews were met with a well developed fire in the void of the end property.  Initially the firefighters were able to fight the fire using hose reel jets while others were carrying out a salvage operation from inside the property. The main firefighting focus was to create a fire break in the thatch to stop the fire spreading. Once this had been achieved they were able to put out the fire and remove all the thatch from the roof.  Because of the danger from the fire overhead, the salvage operation had to be halted and, for safety reasons, crews are still not able to get back inside. They will only be able to re-enter once the building inspector is sure that the structure is safe enough for them to do so.  The crews worked extremely hard to stop the other two Grade II listed cottages from suffering any fire damage and the cause of the fire in the other property is now under investigation by Service investigators. Crews remained at the scene overnight, damping down the area.
