 Fire at a prison in Wilmslow Time of Incident: 09/10/2019 - 12:21 Location: Styal Road, Wilmslow Attendance: Three fire engines attended, one from Poynton and two from Greater Manchester (Stockport and Cheadle) At around 12.20pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire in a workshop at HM Prison Styal.  On arrival at the prison on Styal Road in Wilmslow the crews discovered that a shredder was on fire in a single-storey brick-built building.  The electricity and water supplies to the building were isolated and two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire with a hose reel jet.  Once the fire was out the wooden ceiling was peeled back to expose the joists and firefighters damped the building down to make it safe.  Firefighters were in attendance for more than an hour-and-a-half.
