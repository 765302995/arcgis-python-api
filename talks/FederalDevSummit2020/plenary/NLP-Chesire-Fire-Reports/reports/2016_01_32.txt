Chimney fire which spread to loft space in Poynton Time of Incident: 22/01/2016 - 01:33 Location: Lower Park Crescent, Poynton Attendance: One fire engine from Poynton Firefighters were called to a chimney stack on fire in Poynton. Two seats of fire were found, on in the loft space, so the crew used equipment to cut away loft insulation and chip board to get to the area. The other seat was found in the chimney stack itself and chimney rods which spray a mist of water were used to extinguish this.  An inspection of the loft space of a neighbouring property took place and a thermal imaging camera was used to check for spread of fire. The crew was at this incident for just over four hours.
