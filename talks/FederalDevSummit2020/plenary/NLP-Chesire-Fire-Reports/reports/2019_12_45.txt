 Fire at a house in Widnes Time of Incident: 02/12/2019 - 11:52 Location: Heralds Close, Ditton, Widnes Attendance: Two fire engines attended, one from Widnes and one from Penketh Shortly before noon firefighters were called to a report of a fire at a house in Heralds Close, Ditton, Widnes.  On arrival crews found smoke coming from a first floor bedroom.  No-one was unaccounted for.  Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire with a hose reel jet.  A covering jet and safety jets were also used.  Once the fire was out firefighters inspected the loft space to see if the fire had spread there.  They used a thermal imaging camera and found some hotspots in the loft, which were damped down.  Firefighters wearing respirators damped all the other areas affected by the fire down to make them safe and used a large fan to clear smoke from the house.  They also checked the loft space of neighbouring properties to make sure that the fire had not spread to them.  Firefighters were in attendance for around two hours and 20 minutes.  A fire investigation is being conducted to establish the cause of the fire.
