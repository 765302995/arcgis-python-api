 House fire in Chester Time of Incident: 10/02/2019 - 21:44 Location: Kinnerton Road in Chester Attendance: Three fire engines attended, one from Chester, one from Powey Lane and one from North Wales Fire and Rescue Service. Shortly before 9.45pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a house on Kinnerton Road in Lower KInnerton, Chester. On arrival all persons were accounted for and the semi-detached house was heavily smoke logged.  Smoke was coming out of the windows. The gas and electricity supply to the house were isolated and six firefighters wearing breathing apparatus entered the property. They used two hose reel jets to extinguish the fire.  A safety jet was also put in place. The fire was contained in the living room of the house. Once the fire was out firefighters used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots and a large fan to clear smoke from the house.  A man suffered burns to his head as a result of the fire. He was treated by paramedics and taken to hospital via an ambulance.  The man had tried to go into the house before firefighters arrived as his dog was in there. Unfortunately the man and firefighters were unable to save the dog, who died in the fire.  Firefighters were in attendance for around three hours and forty minutes.  The fire is believed to have been caused by an electrical fault.
