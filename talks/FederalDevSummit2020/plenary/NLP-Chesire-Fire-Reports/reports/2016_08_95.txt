Kitchen fire at a property in Macclesfield Time of Incident: 15/08/2016 - 19:31 Location: Newton Street in Macclesfield Attendance: Two fire engines from Macclesfield and Bollington and the hydraulic platform from Macclesfield Smoke alarms activated during a kitchen fire at a property on Newton Street in Macclesfield, alerting the occupier to the fire.   Two fire crews, including four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, used two hose reel jets and a covering jet to extinguish a well developed fire within the ground floor of a mid-terraced property.  A large fan was used to clear the smoke. The fire was caused by a chip pan that was left unattended.  The fire crews checked the roof space of the property and the neighbouring properties to check that the fire had not spread.  The fire crews requested the attendance of North West Ambulance Service for one male casualty for a check up. Paramedics assessed the casualty and confirmed that he did not need to attend the hospital.  Kitchen fire safety tips.
