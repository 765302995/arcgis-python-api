On arrival the crews discovered that the collision involved two saloon cars and that a heavy goods vehicle was stuck between them.  Someone was trapped inside one of the cars.  Firefighters made the cars safe and, due to the location of one of the vehicles, lane four of the southbound carriageway was closed as the crews worked at the scene.  Firefighters used specialist cutting equipment to remove the roof of the car that the casualty was trapped inside.  They then got the casualty out of the vehicle and handed them over to the care of paramedics.  Firefighters were in attendance for around an hour-and-a-half.
