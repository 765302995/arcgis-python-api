 Tractor fire in Siddington Time of Incident: 20/08/2019 - 16:42 Location: Mill Lane, Siddington Attendance: Two fire engines attended, one from Macclesfield and one from Congleton Shortly after 4.30pm firefighters were called to reports of a tractor being on fire in a road in Mill Lane, Siddington. On arrival the crews found that the fire involved a tractor and a trailer containing approximately 10 tonnes of hay. The fire had destroyed the tractor and the hay was heavily smouldering. The road was closed in both directions and firefighters set up a water supply to get enough water to the area. Three firefighters, two of whom were wearing breathing apparatus, each used a hose reel jet to fight the fire. Once the tractor was free of fire a farmer used another tractor to move it to a field away from overhead cabling. Firefighters then damped down the tractor, the trailer and the hay to make them safe. Farm machinery was used to remove hay from the trailer. A quantity of engine oil and hydraulic fluid had spilt onto the road, which had suffered heat damage. Firefighters used absorbent pads and dry hay to absorb the fluid and contain the  spillage. The farmer then cleared the hay from the road. Once they were satisfied that the area was safe firefighters handed the incident over to Cheshire East Council's highways department. Firefighters were in attendance for around three-and-a-half hours. The fire is believed to have been caused as a result of the tractor's engine overheating.
