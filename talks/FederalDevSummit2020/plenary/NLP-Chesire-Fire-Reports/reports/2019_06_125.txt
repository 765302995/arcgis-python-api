 Fire in a field in Sandbach after an overhead electrical cable snaps Time of Incident: 04/06/2019 - 15:22 Location: Moss Lane, Sandbach Attendance: One fire engine attended from Sandbach Shortly after 3.20pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire in the open at a farm on Moss Lane in Sandbach. On arrival the crew found that an overhead electrical cable had snapped and was hanging over a road. They also discovered that there was a small fire on a field next to the road. Firefighters cordoned off the road in both directions. Police then arrived to deal with the road closure. A utility company was called by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service to isolate the power supply to the cable. An engineer from the company subsequently arrived at the scene and isolated the high voltage power. The fire in the field went out by itself due to the weather conditions. Firefighters handed over the incident to the utility company and were in attendance for more than two hours.
