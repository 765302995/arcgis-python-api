 Garage fire in Northwich Time of Incident: 19/08/2018 - 17:50 Location: Clifton Drive, Northwich Attendance: Two fire engines attended from Northwich At around 5.50pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire at a row of garages on Clifton Drive, Northwich. On arrival crews discovered that one of the garages was well alight and that its owner was not in attendance. A firefighter wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to fight the fire. Crews gained access to the garages either side of the one that was on fire and a covering jet was placed at the back of them to prevent the fire from spreading. Once the fire was out firefighters used a large high pressure fan to clear smoke from the garage that was alight. They also emptied the garage and turned over affected materials and made sure they were safe. Firefighters were in attendance for around an hour-and-a-half. Police also attended. The fire is believed to have been started deliberately.
