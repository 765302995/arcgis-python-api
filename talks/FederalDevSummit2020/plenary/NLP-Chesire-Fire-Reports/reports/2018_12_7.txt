 House fire in Warrington Time of Incident: 27/12/2018 - 17:51 Location: The Coppins, Orford, Warrington Attendance: Three fire engines attended - one from Warrington, one from Birchwood and one from Penketh At around 5.50pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a house at The Coppins in Orford, Warrington. On arrival crews discovered a well developed fire on the first floor of the detached house. They also found that smoke alarms were sounding and all persons were accounted for. Firefighters rescued a dog from the property and isolated the gas, electricity and water supply to the house. Four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire with two hose reel jets. Then then damped the area affected by the fire down to make it safe and used a large high pressure fan to clear smoke from the house. Firefighters also exposed areas of the house to make sure that the fire had not spread to them, including stripping back fascia boards. They used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots and cut away charred material and removed damaged goods from the house. A woman who is believed to have suffered minor burns to her hands and face as a result of the fire was handed over to the care of paramedics and taken to hospital via an ambulance. The fire is believed to have been started accidentally. Firefighters were in attendance for more than three hours. The Red Cross also attended for welfare support.
