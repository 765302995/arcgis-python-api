House fire in Congleton Time of Incident: 29/12/2016 - 21:04 Location: Chapel Street, Congleton Attendance: Two fire engines from Congleton attended along with fire engines from Sandbach, Macclesfield, Alsager, Holmes Chapel, Ellesmere Port, Crewe, Winsford and Nantwich Firefighters were called to a house fire on Chapel Street in Congleton. The house was a large building of converted apartments with adjoining properties. The fire is believed to have originated in a ground floor flat, and affected two flats. Crews, six wearing breathing apparatus, used two hose reel jets and one covering jet to tackle the fire. They then used a large fan to clear smoke from the property before cutting away parts of the interior and using a thermal imaging camera to ensure the fire had not spread any further.   Two people managed to vacate the property before firefighters arrived, and both were later treated for smoke inhalation.  This fire was believed to have been started deliberately.
