 Overheated furnaces following a power cut in Elton Time of Incident: 02/07/2018 - 13:52 Location: Ash Road, Chester Attendance: Two fire engines from Ellesmere Port attended At around 1.50pm firefighters were called to a report of overheated furnaces at Encirc Beverages on Ash Road in Elton. On arrival the crew discovered that, following a power cut in the local area, the plant had shut down two furnaces of molten glass at dangerously high temperatures. Back-up generators were used to cool the furnaces. Fire crews established a water supply and stood by as a precaution. They monitored the furnaces with a thermal imaging camera, checking for hotspots. Power was restored at the plant and back-up generators were then no longer required to cool the furnaces. Fire crews remained at the site for around 20 minutes to monitor the furnaces as they continued to be cooled.
