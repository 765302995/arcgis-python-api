On arrival crews found that the fire involved a prefabricated portable cabin. Firefighters cut the lock on a gate to access the fire and set up a water supply.

Firefighters also damped the destroyed portable cabin down and turned over the affected materials to expose any hotspots. They left the site once there were no signs of any hotspots and they were satisfied that the area affected by the fire and the gas cylinders were safe. Firefighters were in attendance for more than three hours. Police also attended.
