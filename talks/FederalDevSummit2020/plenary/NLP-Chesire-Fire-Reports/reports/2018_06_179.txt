Further investigations on chemicals were then carried out before three firefighters wearing chemical protection suits removed the contents of the chemical cupboard and placed them in lockable metal cabinets outside the school.  A decontamination area was established and another firefighter wearing breathing apparatus assisted with the decontamination.  The chemical protection suits of the firefighters who moved the chemicals were dry peeled.  No firefighters were contaminated during the removal process.  Five chemical protection suits were used in total.  Firefighters were at the scene for around four-and-a-half hours.
