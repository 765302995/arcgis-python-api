 Overheated heavy goods vehicle on the M56 Time of Incident: 10/09/2018 - 18:27 Location: M56 eastbound, between junctions 10 and 9 Attendance: Three fire engines attended - one from Birchwood, one from Warrington and one from Lymm At around 6.30pm firefighters were called to reports of a heavy goods vehicle's rear axle having overheated on the M56 eastbound, between junctions 10 and 9. On arrival crews discovered that the HGV was on the hard shoulder of the motorway. They closed the Junction 10 slip road as they worked at the scene. Firefighters used a hose reel jet to cool down the rear axle. Once they were satisfied that the vehicle was safe it proceeded to nearby services and the slip road was reopened. Firefighters were in attendance for around half-an-hour.
