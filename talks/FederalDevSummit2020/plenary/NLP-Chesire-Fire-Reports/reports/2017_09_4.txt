Building fire in Crewe Time of Incident: 28/09/2017 - 16:37 Location: Macon Way, Crewe Attendance: Fire engines from Crewe, Congleton, Alsager, Nantwich and the aerial ladder platform from Lymm Fire crews were called to a fire in a disused building on Macon Way, Crewe. The fire involved the ground floor, first floor and roof of the building and was approximately 40m x 30m. Crews used three main jets to tackle the blaze initially and set up a 100m cordon. At 7pm crews were using a hose reel jet to fight the fire on an aerial ladder platform. Police evacuated the Grand Junction Retail Park and properties which were downwind of the fire. The road was also closed for several hours as a result of the fire. Crews remained at the scene overnight.

Two large fans were also used to clear smoke from the building.
