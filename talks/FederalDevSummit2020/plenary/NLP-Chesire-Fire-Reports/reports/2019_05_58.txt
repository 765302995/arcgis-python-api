 Outbuilding building fire in Poynton Time of Incident: 23/05/2019 - 00:26 Location: Lostock Hall Road, Poynton. Attendance: Five fire engines attended from Wilmslow, Poynton, Lymm, Offerton and Bollington along with an aerial platform from Lymm. At around 00.30am firefighters were called to reports of a fire in an outbuilding on Lostock Hall Road in Poynton.  Crews from Poynton and Offerton were initially dispatched to the scene and on arrival they discovered a large fire in an unused outbuilding measuring 25 metres by 15 metres.   A cordon was also put in place as a precautionary measure and additional pumps from Lymm, Penketh and Bollington were called to the site along with an aerial platform from Lymm.  Firefighters used one hose reel jet to extinguish the fire from above and a water shuttle was put in place to transport water to the site.  After 6.30am one fire engine was left on site damping down the scene. They used a main jet to try and dislodge an unstable gable end to reach a hotspot. They also pitched a 7m ladder to a structurally sound section of the building to dampen down a roof space.  The building was handed over to the property owner at 2.43pm and fire crews left the site.
