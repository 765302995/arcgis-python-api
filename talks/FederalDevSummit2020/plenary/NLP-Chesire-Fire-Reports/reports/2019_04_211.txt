 Fire at a block of flats in Warrington Time of Incident: 08/04/2019 - 09:24 Location: St Peters Way, Warrington Attendance: Two fire engines attended, one from Penketh and one from Warrington Shortly before 9.30am firefighters were called to a report of a fire at a block of flats on St Peters Way, Warrington. On arrival crews discovered a fire in a battery room in a communal corridor on the first floor and that everyone was accounted for. The power supply to the room was isolated and two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire with a hose reel jet. Firefighters then cleared smoke from the building using a large fan. They also used an extension ladder to check that smoke had not spread to the roof void. Once firefighters were sure that the building was safe they left the incident in the hands of an on-site engineer. Fire crews were in attendance for around 45 minutes.
