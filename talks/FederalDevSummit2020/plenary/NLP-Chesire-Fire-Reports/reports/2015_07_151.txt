Barn on fire in Tattenhall Time of Incident: 09/07/2015 - 09:12 Location: Burwardsley Road, Chester Attendance: Two fire engines from Chester and one each from Tarporley and Ellesmere Port Firefighters attended a barn on fire in Tattenhall. The barn contained approximately 80 tonnes of hay. Two main water jets were used to get the fire under control.             A cordon was set up around the area for safety and the crews worked with the owner to remove bales to an adjacent field using a mechanical digger. These bales were then extinguished by the firefighters.  The barn contained bales, machinery and one LPG gas cylinder, which was cooled using water.             The fire engines were reduced to three by 11am and Burwardsley Road was closed by the Police. Water run off from the fire was contained in a field. Two relief crews were requested to take over the incident at 1.30pm.  The amount of hay in the barn is believed to be around 400 tonnes and firefighters removed it from the damaged barn in order to damp it down.
