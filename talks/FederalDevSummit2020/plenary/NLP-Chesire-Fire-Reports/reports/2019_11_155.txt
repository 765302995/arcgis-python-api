 Fire in a kitchen, Macclesfield Time of Incident: 02/11/2019 - 23:02 Location: Pitt Street, Macclesfield Attendance: One fire engine from Macclesfield Firefighers were called to reports of a burning smell coming from a block of apartments in Pitt Street, Macclesfield. They arrived to find one of the flats was slightly smokelogged, which had been caused by a kettle being left on the hob.  Although the fire was already out before they'd got there, they used a large fan to clear the property of smoke and carried out a home safety assessment with the occupier.
