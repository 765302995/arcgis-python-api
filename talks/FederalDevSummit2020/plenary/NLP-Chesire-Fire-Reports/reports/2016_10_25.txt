Porpoise stuck in mud in Widnes Time of Incident: 26/10/2016 - 15:43 Location: Mersey View Road, Widnes. Attendance: Two fire engines from Warrington and one from Knutsford Firefighters assisted the RSPCA with the rescue of a porpoise from mud flats after it became beached. The crew wore water tight suits to enter the water and keep the porpoise afloat. A marine vet was requested to check the porpoise.  Tony O’Dwyer, Station Manager at Warrington Fire Station attended the incident.  He said: “We were called by the RSPCA to assist in an incident in which a porpoise was stranded in the mud in a side stream leading to the main Mersey estuary. Due to the potential risks associated with the Mersey we mobilised our trained Swift Water Rescue Technicians. When we arrived, members of the public were already in the water attempting to rescue the porpoise.  The Mersey estuary is tidal and conditions do change extremely quickly, coupled with the deep mud individuals entering the water can find themselves in difficulty in a short space of time. Together with the RSPCA, we took the animal into deeper water where a marine vet and medic were able to assess its condition. After about 30 minutes, the vet deemed the porpoise well enough to be released so we set the animal free.  Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service would like to thank members of the public for attempting to rescue the porpoise but we do advise the best thing to do is to call the fire service straight away. In some instances, people have got into difficulty when trying to rescue pets and animals in incidents that the fire service have the equipment to deal with. Fortunately this time everyone involved was able to walk away uninjured and the porpoise was happily released.”
