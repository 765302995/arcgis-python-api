Cow rescued from canal in Nantwich Time of Incident: 21/09/2015 - 16:07 Location: Wrexham Road, Burland, Nantwich Attendance: One fire engine from Nantwich, one fire engine from Knutsford and the Animal Rescue Unit. Rope and mechanical machinery were used to rescue a cow from a canal by the Service's animal rescue teams and firefighters from Nantwich.  The cow was a Limousin, a breed of highly muscled beef cattle which originated from the Limousin region of France.  It weighed around 700kg (just under a ton).  Safety cordons were put in place and the crews used the farmer's telehandler vehicle and their own rescue strops to help with lifting the animal out of the canal because of the urgency of the situation and the weight involved.   An RSPCA officer and a vet were also at the scene while the rescue was being carried out. Once out of the water the animal was thoroughly checked over by the vet.  The crews were at the scene for nearly three hours.             Bollington Fire Station  Knutsford Fire Station  Nantwich Fire Station
