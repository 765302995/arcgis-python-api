House fire in Ellesmere Port Time of Incident: 02/05/2015 - 14:57 Location: The Oval, Ellesmere Port. Attendance: Two fire engines from Ellesmere port, two fire engines and the aerial appliance from Chester. Four fire engines and the aerial appliance were used to tackle a house fire in Ellesmere Port.  The fire involved the first floor of a semi-detached property and had spread to the roof void on arrival of the Service. The aerial appliance was used so the crews could fight the fire from the roof and remove the tiles in order to check the area for hotspots using a thermal imaging camera.  The crews were on the scene for around 8 hours and 40 minutes.   Alongside fighting the fire, the crews rescued an iguana and a snake (boa) from the property.  Firefighter Tom Ardern is pictured here with the iguana.
