 Large tree fire at a farm in Walgherton Time of Incident: 12/05/2019 - 20:07 Location: Crewe Road, Walgherton Attendance: One fire engine attended from Nantwich Shortly after 8pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire involving a tree at a farm on Crewe Road in Walgherton. On arrival the crew found a large tree measuring approximately 25 metres by one metre alight. Firefighters, aided by a short extension ladder and a seven-metre ladder, used an extended hose reel jet to get the fire under control. They monitored temperatures with a thermal imaging camera and cut away burnt parts of the tree with a hand axe. With temperatures being high inside the tree trunk, firefighters used chimney rods and a hose to fight the fire internally. Once the fire was out the crew cut away internal charring and damped the tree down to make it safe. Firefighters were in attendance for around five hours.
