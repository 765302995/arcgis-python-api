Fire at Ellesmere Port stadium Time of Incident: 12/04/2016 - 16:08 Location: Thornton Road, Ellesmere Port Attendance: Two fire engines from Ellesmere Port and one from Chester Firefighters have tackled a fire at the old greyhound stadium on Thornton Road. Crew members from three fire engines wore breathing apparatus and used a hose reel and a covering jet to put out the fire which was underneath one of the stands. A high pressure fan was then used to clear smoke from the area.  This is the second time in less than 24 hours that crews have been called to the stadium - in the early hours of this morning they tackled a fire on the first floor and roof space of one of the other derelict buildings on the site.  Both these fires are believed to have been started deliberately. Please, if anyone has any information about either of the incidents call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or Cheshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 602 of 12 April.     Arson costs lives.
