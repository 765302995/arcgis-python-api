Crews from Stockton Heath, Ellesmere Port and the specialist animal rescue unit from Knutsford attended the incident. They assisted a vet in removing the horse, called Jack, from the ditch. Crews were on the scene for two hours and 30 minutes.  The owner of the horse, Rose Thompson, said Jack was recovering well. She said: "I can't believe they got Jack out of the ditch. They were brilliant with him.  "Jack is ok. We think he had a fit caused by an infection but the vet has given him antibiotics and he seems much better. I can't thank the fire crews enough."  Video Roll over technique used to help Jack (new window, Movie 973KB)  The technique used in the video is called the roll over technique and stimulates the horse to get up. Jack had been sedated by a vet to allow the crews to work safely and allow them to remove him from the ditch, so he was a little sleepy, hence the crews using this technique on him. He then got up and onto his feet.
