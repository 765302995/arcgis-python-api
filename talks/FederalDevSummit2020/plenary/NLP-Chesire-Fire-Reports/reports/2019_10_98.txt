 Large fire involving a farm store in Warrington Time of Incident: 14/10/2019 - 21:15 Location: Winwick Lane, Croft, Warrington Attendance: Six fire engines attended, one from Warrington, one from Lymm, one from Penketh, one from Ellesmere Port and two from Wigan At around 9.15pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a farm on Winwick Lane, Croft, Warrington.  On arrival the crews discovered that a single-storey farm store measuring approximately 10 metres by 20 metres was well alight.  A water relay was set up to get enough water to the timber frame steel clad outbuilding and crews split the fire into four sectors, due to its size.  Four firefighters, including two wearing breathing apparatus, extinguished the fire, each using a hose reel jet.  A number of small gas cylinders were located and cooled down to make them safe.  Once the fire was out firefighters damped the barn down to make it safe and used a thermal imaging camera to check for hot spots.  They also removed debris, as well as external steel cladding from the walls. This was done to expose timber and enable firefighters to ensure that the fire was fully extinguished.  Once all the timber was exposed and there were no signs of any hot spots firefighters left the scene.  They were in attendance for more than five hours.  At its height there were five fire engines in attendance.  An investigation has begun into the cause of the fire.
