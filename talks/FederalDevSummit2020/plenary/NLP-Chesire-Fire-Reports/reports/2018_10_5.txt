 Barn fire in Tarporley Time of Incident: 29/10/2018 - 22:41 Location: Hickhurst Lane, Tarporley Attendance: Two fire engines attended from Crewe, two from Winsford, one from Tarporley, two from Northwich, the aerial ladder platform from Chester and a supporting pump, one engine from Nantwich and one from Audlem. Fire crews were called to a fire in a large brick barn on Hickhurst Lane, Tarporley. On arrival crews found that the barn was well alight and the fire was spreading to an adjacent domestic property.  Crews, four wearing breathing apparatus, used two ground monitors, two hose reel jets, a main jet and the aerial appliance to fight the fire.  The main fire was extinguished by 1.30am and crews spent the night monitoring the site with thermal imaging cameras and dampening down any hot spots.  The cause of the fire was due to an electrical fault.
