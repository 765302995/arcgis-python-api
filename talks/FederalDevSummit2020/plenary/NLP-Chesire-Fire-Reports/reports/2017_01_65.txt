Barn fire in Malpas Time of Incident: 15/01/2017 - 02:47 Location: Higher Wych Road, Malpas Attendance: One fire engine from Malpas and a fire engine from Whitchurch (Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service) Two fire crews attended a small fire involving a barn, which contained animals, on Wych Road in Wigland, Malpas.  Firefighters used one hose reel jet and a thermal image camera to bring the fire under control.  A number of animals were affected by the fire. A sheep had just given birth to two lambs and was unable to move, so oxygen therapy was given to the sheep and the lambs to help with their low oxygen levels.  Special animal oxygen masks, which were carried on Whitchurch's fire engine, were used.
