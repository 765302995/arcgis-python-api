Major industrial building fire near Sandbach Time of Incident: 17/04/2016 - 17:40 Location: Booth Lane, Moston, near Sandbach Attendance: Eight fire engines and a hydraulic platform Just after 5.40pm the Service was called to an automatic fire alarm at a commercial building on Flowcrete Business Park, Booth Lane, Moston, near Sandbach.  Shortly after arriving firefighters from Sandbach found smoke and flames coming through the roof of a brick-built office building measuring approximately 30 metres by 10 metres near the entrance to the site. Attendance was increased to eight fire engines and a hydraulic platform.  Crews wearing breathing apparatus began tackling the fire using hose reel jets. Police were called to the scene and closed nearby roads while firefighters worked to stop the fire from spreading to nearby buildings.  Crews split the incident into sectors to bring the fire under control with firefighters in breathing apparatus setting up two main jets in both sectors one and three using water from the nearby canal. A fire break was established to prevent the blaze from spreading to other parts of the building which was over 2 floors.  Firefighters in breathing apparatus went onto a flat roof of an adjacent part of the building and worked to vent smoke from the premises while a crew in the hydraulic platform were able to use a jet from above.  As crews got the fire under control the number of fire engines at the scene was reduced to 6. Two firefighters in breathing apparatus then entered the premises to assist in salvage operations.  By 9:50pm crews had put the fire out and were damping down hotspots. Attendance at the scene was reduced.
