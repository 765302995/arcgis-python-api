Horse rescue in Tarvin Time of Incident: 09/08/2016 - 11:32 Location: Willington Road, Chester Attendance: One fire engine from Chester and the animal rescue unit with supporting fire engine from Knutsford Firefighters have rescued a horse from a ditch in a field off Willington Road. Molly, a 27 year old black mare, had got herself into the ditch and was unable to get out. Chester firefighters and the specialist animal rescue team from Knutsford fed large strops around Molly which were then attached to a large farm vehicle that could lift her clear of the ditch.  The crews spent almost an hour clearing a safe exit route for the mare and everyone there was delighted when she stood up and walked away from her ordeal.
