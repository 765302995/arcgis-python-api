 Fire at a warehouse in Widnes Time of Incident: 23/09/2018 - 21:49 Location: Mathieson Road, Widnes Attendance: Two fire engines attended - one from Widnes and one from Runcorn At around 9.50pm firefighters were called to a report of piece of machinery being on fire at a Tesco distribution centre on Mathieson Road in Widnes. On arrival crews discovered that a compactor measuring approximately three metres by three metres was on fire inside a container measuring around three metres by 10 metres. The container was inside a warehouse and all persons were accounted for. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used two hose reel jets to extinguish the fire, which spread to the container. A covering jet was also used. Firefighters removed the compactor from the warehouse with a Prime Mover and used a large high pressure fan to clear smoke from the building. Once the fire was out they also used a main jet to damp down the compactor and the container and make sure they were safe. Firefighters were in attendance for around three-and-a-half hours.
