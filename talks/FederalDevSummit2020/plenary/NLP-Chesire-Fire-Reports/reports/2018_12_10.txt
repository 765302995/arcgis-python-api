 Nitrogen leak in Sandbach Time of Incident: 27/12/2018 - 08:58 Location: Hall Lane, Sandbach Attendance: Two fire engines attended - one from Sandbach and one from Crewe Shortly before 9am firefighters were called to a report of a safety disc having popped on a tank of liquid nitrogen in an industrial yard on Hall Lane in Sandbach. On arrival at Newfield Fabrications crews discovered that the tank was releasing nitrogen gas into the atmosphere to reduce the pressure inside the tank. A cloud of water vapour went over nearby fields. It was deemed to not be a danger to the public and gradually dispersed. The 20,000-litre tank was isolated and firefighters undertook atmospheric monitoring. They also liaised with the site's production manager and made sure that the Environment Agency was informed of the incident. Once they were satisfied that the tank was safe firefighters left the scene. They were in attendance for nearly two-and-a-half hours.
