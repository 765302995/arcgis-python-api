 HGV on fire on link road between the M56 and M53 Time of Incident: 19/09/2019 - 21:55 Location: Link road between the M56 westbound at Junction 15 and the M53 southbound at Junction 11 Attendance: Three fire engines attended, one from Powey Lane, one from Chester and one from Ellesmere Port Shortly before 10pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire on the link road between the M56 westbound at Junction 15 and the M53 southbound at Junction 11. On arrival at the slip road between Ellesmere Port and Chester the crews found a heavy goods vehicle well alight. Highways England closed the slip road as firefighters worked at the scene. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire. They then damped the HGV down to make it safe and monitored temperatures with a thermal imaging camera. The HGV's trailer contained foodstuff. Firefighters took foodstuff out of the trailer to check for hot spots inside it. They also cut away part of the trailer that was damaged by the fire. Firefighters were in attendance for nearly an hour-and-a-half. They handed the incident over to Highways England.
