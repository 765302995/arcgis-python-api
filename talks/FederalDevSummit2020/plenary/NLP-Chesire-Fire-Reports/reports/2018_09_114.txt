 House fire in Runcorn Time of Incident: 07/09/2018 - 16:09 Location: Handforth Lane, Runcorn Attendance: Three fire engines attended, from Runcorn, Widnes and Lymm At around 4.10pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a mid-terraced three-floor house on Handforth Lane in Runcorn. On arrival crews discovered a fire on the ground floor of the property that had spread to the first floor and that all persons were accounted for. Four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus began fighting the fire with a hose reel jet and checking if the fire had spread to adjacent properties. A water supply was set up and the gas and electricity supplies were isolated. Once the fire seemed to be out firefighters began damping the area down and dragging out to make the house safe and used a large high pressure fan to clear smoke from the property. They also exposed the ground floor ceiling to check if the fire had spread. Firefighters administered first aid to three casualties suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation before handing them over to the care of paramedics. The casualties were taken to hospital for preliminary checks. The fire caused extensive damage to the ground floor of the house. The first and second floor windows were also severely damaged. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental. Firefighters were in attendance for around two hours.
