 House fire in Warrington Time of Incident: 21/11/2019 - 21:55 Location: Stockport Road, Warrington Attendance: Three fire engines attended, one from Birchwood, one from Warrington and one from Penketh Shortly before 10pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire at a house on Stockport Road, Warrington.  The gas and electricity supplies to the property were isolated and six firefighters wearing breathing apparatus fought the fire.  They used two hose reel jets. A covering jet was also set up.  There was fire on both floors of the house.  Firefighters checked neighbouring properties to make sure that the fire had not spread to them.  Once the fire was out firefighters cut away parts of the house that had been damaged, including ceiling, and damped the property down to make it safe.  They used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots and a large fan to clear smoke from the house.  Firefighters were in attendance for around two hours.  An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
