 Aluminium foundry fire in Congleton Time of Incident: 18/11/2018 - 13:54 Location: Back Lane, Congleton Attendance: Four fire engines attended, from Congleton, Macclesfield, Crewe and Alsager Just before 2pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire at Tandon Metallurgical Group Ltd on Radnor Park Industrial Estate on Back Lane, Congleton. On arrival crews discovered that there had been a small explosion at an aluminium foundry, which was well alight, and that all persons were accounted for. Affected units at the site were evacuated and the gas and electricity supplies to the foundry were isolated. The fire diminished and was contained to the foundry. A water supply was set up and safety jets were put in place outside the foundry. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus had one tonne of sand ready to extinguish the fire. Dry powder extinguishers were also on standby. But the fire went out by itself. Firefighters used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots and made sure that the site was safe before leaving the incident in the hands of on-site staff. Fire crews were in attendance for more than three hours. Police also attended. The A54 was temporarily closed by the police as emergency services worked at the site.
