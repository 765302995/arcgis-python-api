On arrival crews discovered a car well alight outside the brick building measuring approximately 60 metres by 20 metres.  The car fire spread to the youth centre and was affecting its roof space.  The road was closed by police as crews worked at the scene. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used two hose reel jets to extinguish the fire.  A hydraulic platform was used to allow firefighers to remove tiles from the roof and the gas and electricity supply to the building was isolated.  Once the fire was out crews damped the area down and used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots.  The road was reopened at around 6am but firefighters were using a ladder and a thermal imaging camera to check roof voids until around 9.30am - around six-and-a-half hours after the initial call.  The incident is currently under investigation. Anyone with information about the incident should call police on 101, give the details via General Enquiries or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
