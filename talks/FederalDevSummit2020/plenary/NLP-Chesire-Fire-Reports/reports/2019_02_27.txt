 Shed fire in Chester Time of Incident: 24/02/2019 - 11:19 Location: Ryecroft Lane, Chester Attendance: Two fire engines attended - one from Chester and one from Ellesmere Port Shortly before 11.20am firefighters were called to a report of a fire involving an outbuilding at a farm on Ryecroft Lane in Bruen Stapleford, Chester. On arrival crews discovered that a 10 square metre timber shed with metal sheeting had been completely destroyed by a fire that is believed to have started the previous night. With small pockets of fire smouldering, firefighters used two hose reel jets to dampen the area down and make it safe. They also turned over the shed's contents and removed its metal sheeting. The owner of the farm assisted with turning over the shed's contents, using a mechanical digger. Firefighters were in attendance for around an hour and 40 minutes.
