On arrival crews found a large quantity of grass, covering approximately 30 metres by 40 metres, well alight in a St Chad's Catholic and Church of England High School field off Larch Close and Camrose Close.  The size of the fire quickly grew to approximately 50 metres by 50 metres due to the wind.  Firefighters set up a water shuttle to get enough water to the area.  After establishing a water supply, firefighters used two main jets, two hose reel jets and beaters to fight the grass fire.  At approximately 6pm crews became aware that the fire had spread to a nearby house on Camrose Close.  Three crews attended the property and discovered a fire involving a shed and conservatory at the rear of the address.  Four firefighters, wearing breathing apparatus, used one hose reel jet and one main jet to extinguish the fire.  Utility services were also called to the property to isolate the gas and electricity supplies.
