Three wheelie bin fires in Widnes Time of Incident: 07/04/2015 - 21:41 Location: Albert Square and Widnes Road, Widnes Attendance: Two fire engines from Widnes Firefighters dealt with three separate deliberate wheelie bin fires in Widnes.  At 21:41 the crews used one hose reel to extinguish a fire involving a large wheelie bin which had spread up the wall and melted the guttering on Albert Square. A thermal imaging camera was also used.  Whilst dealing with this incident the firefighters were made aware of another fire on the same road involving two wheelie bins. One hose reel was again used to put out the fire.  As the crews were returning to station at 22:02 they were diverted to another bin fire on Widnes Road. The fire was out on arrival as the shop keeper had extinguished it so the firefighters damped down the scene to ensure it was fully extinguished.  Police attended the scene and are investigating. Anyone with any information is asked to call police on 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.  Wheelie Bin - Fire Safety advice
