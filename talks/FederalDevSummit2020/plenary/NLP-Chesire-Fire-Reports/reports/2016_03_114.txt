Silo fire at Warrington business Time of Incident: 11/03/2016 - 10:48 Location: Shred-It, Lyncastle Road,Appleton Thorn, Warrington Attendance: One fire engine from Birchwood and one from Warrington Firefighters have tackled a fire in a silo at a business on Appleton Thorn trading estate. The building was evacuated as crews began dealing with the incident. They used  a thermal imaging camera to check for fire spread within the silo and then cooled the machinery using a hose reel jet.  Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus then removed the sides of the inspection panel so that contents could be doused. As these operations took place outside the building staff were able to go back inside to their workplace.   The crews were at the scene for just over four hours. They had to remove more panels and extract smouldering paper waste. The fire was caused by an ember from the process being drawn into the dust extraction system.
