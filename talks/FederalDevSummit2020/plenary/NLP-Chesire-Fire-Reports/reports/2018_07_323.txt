 House fire, Runcorn Time of Incident: 30/06/2018 - 15:33 Location: Hedge Hey, Runcorn Attendance: Two fire engines from Runcorn and Widnes Firefighters responded to reports of smoke coming from a ground floor flat in Hedge Hey. Closer examination revealed the smoke was coming from within a cavity wall and a fire was located within it. Crews used cutting tools to break through the wall and then a hose reel to extinguish the flames.  Further checks were made in the property, and this led them to removing part of a wall in the flat above, where the fire had spread to. They were in attendance for around two-and-a-half hours.
