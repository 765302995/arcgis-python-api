 Chimney fire in Goostrey Time of Incident: 12/04/2019 - 19:51 Location: Shearbrook Lane, Goostrey Attendance: One fire engine attended from Middlewich Shortly before 8pm firefighters were called to a report of a chimney fire at a domestic property on Shearbrook Lane in Goostrey. On arrival the crew discovered that the fire in the chimney had been caused by a fallen bird's nets having been set alight by a gas fire. The nest was burning between the flue and the bricks of the chimney. The gas fire was isolated and the crew used a thermal imaging camera to monitor temperatures on the first floor of the property and in the roof space. Firefighters used a seven-metre ladder to remove the chimney cowl and pot and then the bird's nest. At that point there was still burning material within the chimney breast. The crew used the 7m ladder, a roof ladder and working at height safety equipment to remove a blockage from above. Firefighters then removed the gas fire and the flue to enable them to access and extinguish the fire and remove debris and smouldering embers from the chimney breast. Once the fire was out they used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots and make sure that the property was safe. They were in attendance for around an hour and 45 minutes.
