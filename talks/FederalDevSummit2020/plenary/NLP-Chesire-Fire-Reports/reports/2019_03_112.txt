On arrival everyone was accounted for and crews discovered that the fire involved hot process work in an industrial unit. There was a small fire on a gantry and the sprinkler system had activated and suppressed the fire. The building was evacuated and its electrics, gas, oil and compressed air were all isolated. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire. A covering jet was also set up. Once the fire was out a thermal imaging camera was used to check for hotspots and make sure that the building was safe. The fire left the 200 metres by 100 metres building heavily smoke lagged. Firefighters used a large fan to clear the smoke. An environmental grab pack was used to deal with water that had run off. Firefighters were in attendance for around two hours and 15 minutes.
