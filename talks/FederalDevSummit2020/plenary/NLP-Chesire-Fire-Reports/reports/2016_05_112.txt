Building fire in Wardle Time of Incident: 11/05/2016 - 16:08 Location: Green Lane, Wardle Attendance: Fire engines from Nantwich and Crewe (2) and the hydraulic platform and supporting fire engine from Chester Firefighters tackled a fire at a timber yard in Wardle. The fire involved an induction pipe for shredded timber. Covering jets were put into position as firefighters used a thermal imaging camera on the pipe to check the site of the fire. Utility supplies to the building were isolated and platforms set up for the crews to tackle the fire using hose reel and covering jets. Pipework was cut away in the search for hotspots and the hydraulic platform was used to cool the dust tower on the outside of the building.  The firefighters worked with the site team to remove around 15 metres of internal ducting. They then damped the area down and, after checking the temperature of the dust tower, were able to withdraw the hydraulic platform. The fire site was checked using a thermal imaging camera to make sure there were no further hotspots and the incident handed over to the site management team.
