 Bin fires, Widnes Time of Incident: 10/05/2019 - 21:35 Location: Moor Lane, Widnes Attendance: One fire engine from Widnes Firefighters were called following reports of a number of wheelie bins on fire near the Leigh Recreation Ground. They found a total of four bins well alight, which are thought to have been deliberately set alight by a large group of youths. They used a single hose reel to put the fires out, and requested the attendance of the police due to the deliberate ignition and the youths still being in the area.  They were called again around half an hour later to the Recreation Ground on Dundalk Road, as another wheelie bin had been set alight in the park. Once more, they used a single hose reel to extinguish the flames.
