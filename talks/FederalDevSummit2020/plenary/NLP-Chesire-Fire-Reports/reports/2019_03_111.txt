On arrival crews discovered that everyone was accounted for and that the smoke was caused by overheating in a wax making process. The equipment making the wax was isolated and two firefighters using breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to cool it and the product that had overheated. They later replaced their breathing apparatus with respirators. Once it was safe to do so the affected equipment was removed from the building and allowed to cool further. Firefighters also used a large fan to clear smoke from the building. They were in attendance for around an hour.
