 Fire at a chip shop in Chester Time of Incident: 13/05/2018 - 15:50 Location: The Parade, Blacon, Chester Attendance: Four fire engines attended - two from Ellesmere Port, one from Chester and one from Powey Lane - as well as a hydraulic platform from Chester At around 3.50pm firefighters were called to a fire at a chip shop at The Parade in Blacon, Chester. On arrival they discovered lots of smoke coming from a chimney and that the fire at the chip shop, which is part of a row of terraced shops, involved a fryer. Four firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used two hose reel jets to extinguish the fire, which was confined to the chip shop. They then used a large high pressure fan to clear the smoke and a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots. The loft space was checked and a hydraulic platform was set up and cooled the chimney. One casualty suffering from smoke insulation was passed over to the care of paramedics. Firefighters were in attendance for nearly three hours.
