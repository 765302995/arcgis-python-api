 Domestic building fire in Warrington Time of Incident: 22/06/2019 - 06:56 Location: Collin Street, Warrington Attendance: Four fire engines attended - one from Warrington, two from Penketh and one from Lymm - as did an aerial ladder platform from Lymm Shortly before 7am firefighters were called to a report of a fire at a domestic property in Collin Street, Warrington, and flames coming through the roof. On arrival crews gained accesses to the property and discovered that no-one was inside. The gas and electricity supplies to the premises were isolated and two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire. The roof space was difficult to gain access to. An aerial ladder platform from Lymm enabled firefighters to do this. The roof space was subsequently inspected. After the fire was out water was used to damp the roof space down and make it safe. A thermal imaging camera was used to monitor temperatures. Firefighters also checked neighbouring properties for any signs of the fire having spread to them. They only left the scene after they were satisfied that the fire had not spread and the property was safe. The incident was closed at around 2pm.
