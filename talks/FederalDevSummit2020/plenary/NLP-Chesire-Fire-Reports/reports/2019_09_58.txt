 Campervan fire on the M6 Time of Incident: 20/09/2019 - 10:25 Location: M6 northbound, between junctions 18 and 19 Attendance: Three fire engines attended, one from Middlewich, one from Holmes Chapel and one from Lymm Shortly before 10.30am firefighters were called to reports of a campervan being on fire on the M6 northbound, between junctions 18 and 19. On arrival crews found the vehicle well alight. They cordoned off the first two lanes of the motorway and two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus each used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire. Firefighters then damped down the campervan to make it safe. They also used a thermal imaging camera to monitor the temperatures of three gas cylinders that were removed from the campervan before firefighters arrived at the scene. No-one is believed to have been injured as a result of the fire. Firefighters were in attendance for around an hour and 45 minutes. They handed the incident over to Highways England.
