Fence on fire in Warrington Time of Incident: 29/07/2015 - 22:01 Location: Vulcan Close, Poulton-with-Fearnhead, Warrington Attendance: Two fire engines from Warrington and one from Birchwood A fence on fire also involved the outside of a house in Poulton-with-Fearnhead. Two hose reel jets were used by firefighters to put out the blaze which was found to have spread to the loft space of two properties. Crews wearing breathing apparatus put out the loft fires and high pressure fans used to clear smoke from the affected areas. Crews climbed a seven metre ladder to be able to cut away the external eaves from both properties to check there was no fire spread. Firefighters in respirators then removed loft insulation from the two houses.  There were no casualties involved in the incident which is believed to have been caused by an unattended barbecue setting fire to the fence.   Please take care when using barbecues - Barbecue safety
