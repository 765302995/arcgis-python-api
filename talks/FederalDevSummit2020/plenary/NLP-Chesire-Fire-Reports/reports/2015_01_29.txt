Attendance: Fire engines from Northwhich, Winsford, Middlewich, Knutsford and the Hazadous material unit from Crewe. Fire crews were called to a report of a suspected chemical leak at Morrisons Distribution Centre on King Street in Northwich.

However, this turned out to be a false alarm caused by a fault on the alarm system. No action was required.
