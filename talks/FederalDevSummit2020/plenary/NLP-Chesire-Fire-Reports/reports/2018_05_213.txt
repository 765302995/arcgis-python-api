On arrival crews discovered that the fire involved plant machinery at the commercial premises measuring approximately 3,000 square metres. All persons were accounted for and two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus and respirators used two hose reel jets to extinguish the fire. Feathering jets were also used and once the fire was out the crews cooled around 600 tonnes of surrounding waste. Firefighters used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots and damped the area down. Two casualties suffering from smoke inhalation were handed over to the care of paramedics. They were treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. Fire crews were in attendance for around two-and-a-half hours.
