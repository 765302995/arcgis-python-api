They continued well into the evening and by 11pm were satisfied that a thorough inspection of the site had been carried out with no further signs of fire or heat. A further inspection of the site was carried out this morning and the situation was the same. One more inspection will be carried out this afternoon to ensure that the warmer weather does not cause further issues.  The fire service left the site at 9am on August 12.
