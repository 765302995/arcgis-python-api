 Flooding at a residential property in Neston Time of Incident: 12/06/2019 - 06:28 Location: Carlton Close, Neston. Attendance: One fire engine attended from Powey Lane At around 6.30am firefighters from Powey Lane were dispatched to reports of flooding at an address in Neston.  On arrival the crew discovered that water was running off a field into a garage causing a flood approximately one foot deep.   Due to the depth of the flood water there was a risk that the flooding may spread to the attached house.  Crews removed a number of bricks from the rear of the garage to allow the water to flow through the garage and into a drain - preventing any water entering the house.  Firefighters were in attendance for around one hour 30 minutes.
