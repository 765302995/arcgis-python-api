 Chimney fire in Malpas Time of Incident: 24/02/2019 - 19:39 Location: Wynter Lane, Tilaston, Malpas Attendance: Two fire engines attended - one from Malpas and one from Tarporley - as did an aerial ladder platform from Chester At around 7.40pm firefighters were called to a report of a fire involving a domestic property's tiled chimney on Wynter Lane in Tilaston, Malpas. On arrival crews discovered a chimney well alight. The fire had affected the chimney stack at a neighbouring domestic property. Crews set up a 13.5-metre ladder, a roof ladder and working at height safety equipment. Firefighters also made a hole in a wall due to a fireplace having been boarded up. Once the fireplace was opened up firefighters fought the fire from below with a hose reel jet. They checked the temperature of the loft space with a thermal imaging camera whilst damping down the main chimney breast. Firefighters put water into the chimney liner from the loft space. They monitored the temperature of the chimney and its liner with the camera. Once they were sure the fire was out and that both properties were safe - having checked the neighbouring property - firefighters left the scene. They were in attendance for around five-and-a-half hours. For tips on avoiding a chimney fire visit https://www.cheshirefire.gov.uk/public-safety/home-safety/chimneys.
