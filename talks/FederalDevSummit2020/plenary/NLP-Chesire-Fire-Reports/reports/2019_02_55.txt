 Commercial building fire in Winsford Time of Incident: 21/02/2019 - 14:13 Location: Leslie Road, Winsford Attendance: Two fire engines attended - one from Winsford and one from Northwich Shortly before 2.15pm firefighters were called to reports of a fire involving a plastics bay at a Kier MG Ltd building on Leslie Road in Winsford. The bailer was isolated by on-site personnel, who used a mechanical digger to remove products from it. They also isolated the electricity supply to the bailer. On arrival firefighters discovered that there was a large quantity of waste at the site. There no signs of fire but crews saw small pockets of smoke as products were removed from the bailer by the on-site personnel. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to make the bailer safe. The crews then dug products out of the bailer, damped the area down and used a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots. Once they were satisfied that the area was safe firefighters handed the incident over to on-site management. They were in attendance for more than an hour-and-a-half. Paramedics also attended. They assessed one of the on-site workers.
