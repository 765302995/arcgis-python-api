The crews, four wearing breathing apparatus, used one main and two hose reel jets to put out the fire.  A high pressure fan was then used to clear smoke from the building.   The fire was caused by an electrical fault in halogen ceiling lights, where the heat had caused combustible materials in the loft to ignite.
