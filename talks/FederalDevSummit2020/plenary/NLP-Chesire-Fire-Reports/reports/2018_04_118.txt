 Hay fire in Crewe Time of Incident: 08/04/2018 - 10:30 Location: The B5078, Crewe Attendance: One fire engine attended from Alsagar At around 10.30am firefighters were called to a fire on the grass verge of the B5078 which runs parallel to junction 16 of the M56 in Crewe. On arrival the crew discovered a large pile of hay smouldering. Firefighters used two hose reel jets and a stack drag and damped the area down. They were at the scene for around two-and-a-half hours and, after contacting Cheshire East Highways to request the approximately 15 tonnes of hay be removed from the roadside, they returned at around 5.45pm to re-inspect the area. On their return firefighters used a hose reel jet and further damped down the area to ensure that the pile of hay was safe.
