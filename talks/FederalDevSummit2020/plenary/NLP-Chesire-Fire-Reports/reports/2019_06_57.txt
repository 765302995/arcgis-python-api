On arrival crews found that all of the occupants had got off the coach and were safe and well. There had been approximately 65 children on the coach, who were waiting on the hard shoulder for alternative transport. The A556/A50 slip road was closed by Highways England whilst the incident was dealt with. Fire crews isolated the battery and cooled the coach's engine down using a hose reel jet. They then used a thermal imaging camera to check the temperature of the engine and make sure that it was safe. Firefighters also assisted with the removal of the children's belongings from the coach. They then handed the incident over to a coach engineer who had arrived at the scene. Firefighters were in attendance for around 45 minutes.
