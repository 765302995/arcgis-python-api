 Sawdust fire in a container at a timber yard in Winsford Time of Incident: 23/11/2018 - 09:06 Location: Smokehall Lane, Winsford Attendance: Two fire engines attended - one from Winsford and one Northwich Shortly after 9am firefighters were called to a report of a fire involving a container full of sawdust on a trailer in a timber yard at Smokehall Lane Industrial Estate in Winsford. On arrival crews found the container smouldering near to a building. Firefighters initially used a hose reel jet to cool the contents of the container through vents. Once the trailer had been moved away from the building the rear door of the container was opened. Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus then each used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire and cool the container. The drains in the vicinity were capped and on-site personnel used a JCD to remove affected sawdust from the container. Fire crews shuttled water to the area as firefighters damped down the container and the sawdust. Around 40 per cent of the sawdust inside the container was removed from the container until it was deemed to be safe with no signs of fire spread. Firefighters were in attendance for around three hours.
