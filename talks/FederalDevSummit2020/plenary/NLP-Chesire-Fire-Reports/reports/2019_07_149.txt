 Kitchen fire, Warrington Time of Incident: 06/07/2019 - 22:56 Location: Samuel Street, Warrington Attendance: Three fire engines from Warrington, Penketh and Widnes Firefighters were called out to tackle a kitchen fire at a house in Great Sankey. Two firefighters used breathing apparatus and a hose reel to extinguish the flames, and a large fan to ventilate the property.  One casualty was assessed at the scene by paramedics but did not need to go to hospital. No smoke alarms were fitted at the property, so a home safety assessment was carried out with the occupier. Crews were in attendance for around 45 minutes.
