 Kitchen fire in Nantwich flat Time of Incident: 12/10/2019 - 00:44 Location: Jubilee Gardens, Nantwich Attendance: Three fire engines attended, one from Nantwich and two from Crewe At around 12.45am firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a flat in Jubilee Gardens, Nantwich.  On arrival the crews discovered a fire in the kitchen of the ground floor flat and that no-one was unaccounted for.  Two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used a hose reel jet to extinguish the fire.  Once the fire was out a thermal imaging camera was used to check for hotspots to make sure that the flat was safe.  A large fan was used to clear smoke from the flat.  A man suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation, who was outside the flat when firefighters arrived, was assessed by paramedics before being taken to hospital via an ambulance.  Firefighters were in attendance for more than an hour.  The fire is believed to have been caused by food cooking in a pan having been left unattended.
